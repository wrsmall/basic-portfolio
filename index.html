        <p class="bio">Hello, my name is William Small, Im a pretty laid back guy that always enjoys a challenge. When Im not working, I enjoy 
            spending time with my wife, Stephanie, aas well as our dog and two cats. I love anything and everything outside, however my favorite 
            activites include hiking, fishing, and camping. I graduated from Radford University in May 2012, with a bachelors in Marketing. I enjoy 
            bringing and applying my skillsets as well as adapting new ones for a company. I look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
